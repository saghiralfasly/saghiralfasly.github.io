I received my Ph.D. degree in information and communication engineering (Computer Vision & Machine Learning) from the School of Electronics and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, China. My current research interests include video understanding, action recognition, surveillance image and video analysis, video representation learning, person/vehicle re-identification, computer vision, and machine learning.

After 5 years or work research in ML and CV, my main aim is to bridge the gap between academia and industry and to see my ideas in real-world solutions.
